# Hangman
Arguably the best game you could possibly play as a kid to pass time at school, 
this was assigned as a first year course project to be coded in java, where a score counter 
keeps track of your individual score throughout a round, as you attempt to complete a word in 7 attempts.
At the end of the round, if you are in the top 5 all time highscores list, the game allows you to enter your
name to be stored in an external txt file.
